# Minimum Lovable Governance (MLG)

Minimum Lovable Governance (MLG) is a lightweight, standards-driven model for governing data products without slowing delivery. It replaces heavy, centralized control with simple, automatable rules stored in Git.

## Purpose

MLG defines the smallest possible set of governance practices that still ensure:

* Quality — datasets meet agreed standards
* Trust — clear ownership, license, and SLA
* Reusability — every data product follows one structure
* Scalability — governance grows with automation, not headcount

## Core idea

Governance should enable, not block. MLG encodes rules as code and documentation that humans and AI can both follow.

* **Specification** Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) defines structure and metadata
* **Automation** Validation, CI, and AI assistance enforce consistency
* **Transparency** Everything stored in Git for traceability and peer review

## Key principles

1. Minimum, not minimal — just enough control to stay compliant and aligned
2. Lovable — practical to use, respected by teams
3. As Code — YAML, schemas, workflows replace manual governance
4. Reusable Components — quality rules, SLAs, licenses as shared libraries
5. AI-Ready — structured so AI tools can author, validate, and explain compliance

## Why it matters

Traditional governance:

* Too heavy for fast data product delivery
* Creates bottlenecks and frustration

MLG:

* Fits agile and DevOps culture
* Keeps accountability clear
* Bridges business, engineering, and AI in one model
