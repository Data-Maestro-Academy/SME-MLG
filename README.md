# DIY Minimum Lovable Governance (MLG) – GitHub-Managed Data Product Governance with Claude in VS Code

Learn how to build an AI-assisted, GitHub-governed data product governance model using the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS). This setup shows how Claude in VS Code can generate, validate, and refine ODPS-compliant YAML specs using local schemas and soft guardrails.

Each week adds a new building block:
• Week 1 – Setup & Minimal Data Product (Claude + ODPS schema)
• Week 2 – Product Strategy (value, KPIs, alignment)
• Week 3 – Data Contracts (internal use and reuse)
• Week 4 – Reusable Data Quality Library
• Week 5 – Reusable SLA Library
• Week 6 – Access Profiles Library
• Week 7 – Pricing & Licensing Blocks

## Includes:
• Full ODPS 4.1 schema and examples
• Project rule file for AI behavior guidance
• VS Code settings for real-time YAML validation
• Quickbite path for DIY MLG framework (Strategy, Contracts, DQ, SLA, Access, Pricing, Licensing)

Built and documented by Dr. Jarkko Moilanen, creator of ODPS and the Minimum Lovable Governance model for data products.
