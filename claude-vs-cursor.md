# Claude Code vs Cursor â€” A Practical Comparison

When working with AI in VS Code to generate YAML or JSON specifications aligned with the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS), two tools often come up: Claude Code and Cursor. 
While both support code generation, structured text, and smart prompts, they are built for different purposes. It is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Both are fruits, but still very different.

**Claude Code** is best suited for crafting individual specifications. It excels at understanding complex schema structures and producing output that aligns well with schema constraints, 
especially when given proper context. Its natural language responses make it helpful for business-facing use cases where the output needs to be both correct and readable. 
It works well when the task involves generating one complete, structured spec that explains itself clearly. However, it is not optimized for editing many files at once or 
performing batch operations across a project.

**Cursor** is more oriented toward developers managing large codebases or structured documents at scale. It shines in use cases that involve bulk editing, consistent refactoring across many files,
and applying patterns across entire directories. Cursor can process a full repository context and apply edits intelligently to multiple files. That makes it ideal when your goal is to scale, 
automate, or maintain consistency in a large collection of data product specs. On the other hand, it may feel less natural when writing explanations or descriptions for business users.

**In short:**

* Claude Code is the better choice for high-quality authoring of individual specs, especially in business-oriented contexts.
* Cursor is the stronger option for maintaining or transforming a full set of structured specs across a project.

Both tools can operate inside VS Code and benefit from having the full ODPS spec locally available in your workspace. Selecting the right tool depends on whether you are writing, 
scaling, or refactoring.

For business-oriented users who want to focus on writing one clear, standard-compliant spec at a time, Claude Code is the more natural fit. It works well with plain prompts, 
explains its output clearly, and respects schema context when the project is set up properly. 

Cursor is powerful for developers managing many files or doing structural edits across large repos, but it leans more technical. 

If your goal is to define high-quality data product specs with minimal friction and clear language, Claude is likely the better companion.
